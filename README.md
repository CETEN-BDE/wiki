<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS -->
# Basic project template

This is a generic project template, without a specific programming language. It should follow the general workflow for the organization, and should be used when creating a new project.

More specific templates will be available later for more specialized projects (backend api, web front ...), with CI/CD already setup. Fore more information, see the [organization's templates](https://github.com/orgs/CETEN-BDE/repositories?q=template%3Atrue+archived%3Afalse).

## Template content

- Default MIT license
- README.md template with badges
- Issue labels
- Issue templates (soon)
- Git flow structure
- Branch protection rules

## How to use this template

1. Click on the "Use this template" button on the top right of the repo's page.
2. **Check the "Include all branches" checkbox**
3. Follow the next steps to setup the newly created repository

### Update the issue templates

Change the assignees for each issue template in the [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) folder.

### Update the README

The easiest way to use this README template is with a text editor that supports replacing strings with regexp (eg. vscode).

#### Code Climate maintainability badge

This badge displays the CodeClimate maintainability report for the repository. For this badge to work, you need to [add the created repository in codeclimate](https://codeclimate.com/github/repos/new).

Login with your github account, the CETEN-BDE organization should already allow access for codeclimate. Contact the CETEN-BDE maintainers if you need help for this step.

If the repository needs to remain private, or maintainability is irrelevant, remove the badge from the top of the README.

#### Fill the template

Fill the README template below these instructions. You can replace the following placeholders :

- `PROJECT_TITLE` : The project name, used in the title
- `basic-project` : The name of the repository (the part after the organization's name in the URL)

#### Remove the template instructions

When everything is setup, remove these instructions from the README. This can be done eaysily by replacing the following regexp with an empty string :

```regex
<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS -->(.|\n)*<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS -->
```

<br/>
<br/>

Following this line is the README.md template to fill.
